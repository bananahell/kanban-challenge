## Instalation and usage

The project uses Postgres inside a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container.  

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is used to connect the project with the database.  

```
npm add -D prisma
npm add @prisma/client
```

## Introduction

I've received this challenge in the 25<sup>th</sup> of October, 2023, with the deadline on the 9<sup>th</sup> of November.  
This is a back-end project that will use NestJS with typescript as framework and PostgresSQL as database.  

The project is a Kanban board with user authorization management.
